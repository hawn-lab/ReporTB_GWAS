Reading PLINK FAM file from [plink_concord/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.fam].
2754 individuals to be included from [plink_concord/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.fam].
Reading PLINK BIM file from [plink_concord/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.bim].
2527008 SNPs to be included from [plink_concord/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.bim].
2527008 SNPs from chromosome 1 to chromosome 22 are included in the analysis.
Reading PLINK BED file from [plink_concord/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.bed] in SNP-major format ...

Recoding genotypes (individual major mode) ...

Calculating the genetic relationship matrix (GRM) ... (Note: default speed-optimized mode, may use huge RAM)

Summary of the GRM:
Mean of diagonals = 1.01767
Variance of diagonals = 0.0266436
Mean of off-diagonals = -0.000369676
Variance of off-diagonals = 0.00128047
GRM of 2754 individuals has been saved in the file [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.grm.bin] (in binary format).
Number of SNPs to calculate the genetic relationship between each pair of individuals has been saved in the file [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.grm.N.bin] (in binary format).
IDs for the GRM file [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.grm.bin] have been saved in the file [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.grm.id].
