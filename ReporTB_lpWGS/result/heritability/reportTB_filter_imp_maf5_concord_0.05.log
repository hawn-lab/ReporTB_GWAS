Reading IDs of the GRM from [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.grm.id].
2754 IDs are read from [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.grm.id].
Reading the GRM from [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.grm.bin].
Reading the number of SNPs for the GRM from [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.grm.N.bin].
GRM for 2754 individuals are included from [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord.grm.bin].
Pruning the GRM with a cutoff of 0.05 ...
After pruning the GRM, there are 1025 individuals (1729 individuals removed).
GRM of 1025 individuals has been saved in the file [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord_0.05.grm.bin] (in binary format).
Number of SNPs to calculate the genetic relationship between each pair of individuals has been saved in the file [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord_0.05.grm.N.bin] (in binary format).
IDs for the GRM file [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord_0.05.grm.bin] have been saved in the file [heritability/reportTB_filter_imp_maf5_concord_0.05.grm.id].
